## Approach 

-> My approach was to come up with a design that was simple and straighforward. Something anyone could pick up and use and not even need instructions. Intuitive. The user creates his/her account or logs in to their existing account with Devise authentication. They would be greeted with a welcome sign after login and brought to their vision board page. I wanted it to be desgined for laptop or desktop with the option for mobile. The reason for this is mainly just the way you search in app and drag images around you would want a bigger screen. The in app search bar is optimized for searching images and quotes specifically. Also wanted to give the users an opportunity to share their boards with their friends through facebook. 

## Unsolved-Problems

- Facebook sharing
- Saving dragged items state to the users account so when they come back to a board everything was where they left it.
- Goals list
- Quotes search bar
- Completed boolean click button to show whether the board is completed or not.
- Some styling

## Notes-To-Self

-> Style as you go. Do not move on to another task or strecth goal until MVP is achieved. You are getting better but still focus on the basics and make sure you follow user stories to stay on task and complete projects on time. Stay organized and focus and you will succeed.
